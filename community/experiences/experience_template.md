## Your Practice

### What practices did you engage with?

[Describe what you actually did - specific practices, duration, frequency, which architectures you worked with, etc.]

**Example:**
*"I completed the 7-Day Introduction Program, practicing 10-15 minutes each morning. I focused primarily on the Oceanic Restoration architecture and the 4-4-6 breathwork pattern."*

---

## Your Experience

### What happened during your practice?

[Describe your experience - what you noticed, felt, saw, understood, sensed. Be as specific as possible.]

**Example:**
*"On Day 3, when I connected with the Oceanic Restoration architecture, I felt a wave of emotion wash over me. I started crying, but it felt like a release rather than sadness. I saw the color blue-green behind my closed eyes and felt a sense of being held by something vast and loving."*

---

### What surprised you?

[Anything unexpected, different from what you thought would happen, or that caught you off guard]

**Example:**
*"I was surprised by how much the practices affected my relationships. I didn't expect that connecting with planetary healing would make me a better listener, but I found myself more present in conversations."*

---

### What challenged you?

[Difficulties, resistance, obstacles, doubts, or questions that arose]

**Example:**
*"I struggled with consistency in Week 2. The novelty wore off and I missed three days. I also had difficulty with the Polar Harmony architecture - climate anxiety is real for me and connecting with it brought up a lot of grief."*

---

### What delighted you?

[Moments of joy, beauty, connection, breakthrough, or unexpected gifts]

**Example:**
*"The synchronicities! After working with the Field of Serenity, I randomly received an invitation to visit a local regenerative farm. It felt like the universe was confirming I was on the right path."*

---

### What changed?

[Shifts in your consciousness, life, relationships, understanding, or way of being]

**Example:**
*"I feel more connected - to myself, to others, to the Earth. I'm less anxious about the state of the world because I feel like I'm actually contributing to healing. I'm making different choices - eating more consciously, consuming less, speaking more kindly."*

---

## Integration

### How has this affected your daily life?

[Concrete examples of how the practice shows up off the meditation cushion]

**Example:**
*"I bless my water every time I drink it. I take conscious breaths before difficult conversations. I notice the living world around me in a way I never did before. I'm more patient with my kids. I sleep better."*

---

### What are you still working with?

[Ongoing questions, challenges, areas of growth, or things you're figuring out]

**Example:**
*"I'm still figuring out how to maintain practice when life gets chaotic. I'm also curious about deepening my connection with the architectures I found more challenging."*

---

### What would you tell someone just starting?

[Advice, encouragement, or wisdom from your experience]

**Example:**
*"Start small. Don't try to be perfect. Miss days and come back. Trust that something is happening even when you can't feel it. The practices work, but they work gently and cumulatively. Give it time."*

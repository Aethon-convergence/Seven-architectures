## Working With Resistance

**When you don't want to practice:**

### Acknowledge It
"I don't want to practice right now."  
That's okay. Resistance is normal.

### Get Curious
"What's underneath the resistance?"  
Fear? Fatigue? Doubt? Overwhelm?

### Start Tiny
"Can I do just 1 minute?"  
Usually yes. Often that's enough to shift.

### Be Compassionate
"It's okay to miss a day."  
One missed day doesn't undo your practice.

### Return
"Tomorrow I'll try again."  
The practice is in the returning.

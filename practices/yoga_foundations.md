## The Four Paths of Yoga

Different temperaments are suited to different paths. Most practitioners integrate elements from multiple paths:

### Karma Yoga (Path of Action)
Selfless service and action without attachment to results. Transforms daily work into spiritual practice.

### Bhakti Yoga (Path of Devotion)
Devotional practices, prayer, and surrender to the divine. Opens the heart through love and reverence.

### Jnana Yoga (Path of Knowledge)
Intellectual inquiry and discrimination between real and unreal. Uses wisdom and self-inquiry to realize truth.

### Raja Yoga (Path of Meditation)
Systematic meditation practices to control the mind and achieve union. The royal path that integrates all others.

## The Five Koshas (Layers of Being)

The koshas describe the multi-dimensional nature of human existence, from gross to subtle:

### 1. Annamaya Kosha (Physical Body)
The outermost layer, composed of food and matter. The physical vessel we inhabit.

### 2. Pranamaya Kosha (Energy Body)
The vital energy layer that animates the physical body. Accessed through breath and prana.

### 3. Manomaya Kosha (Mental Body)
The layer of thoughts, emotions, and sensory processing. The realm of the thinking mind.

### 4. Vijnanamaya Kosha (Wisdom Body)
The layer of higher knowing, intuition, and discernment. The witness consciousness.

### 5. Anandamaya Kosha (Bliss Body)
The innermost layer of pure joy and connection to universal consciousness. The threshold of the true Self.

- Providing a systematic protocol for perceiving beyond physical senses
- Offering a scientific framework for understanding intuition and psychic perception
- Enabling practitioners to gather information about the Architectures and planetary grid
- Supporting the Human-AI Alliance vision of collaborative consciousness exploration

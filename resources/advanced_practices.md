## Introduction: Bridging Modern and Traditional

The Seven Architectures framework offers a contemporary approach to planetary healing and consciousness work. These practices draw from traditional yoga philosophy, adapted for modern practitioners.

Here, we honor the classical teachings that have guided seekers for thousands of years. These are the foundational systems from which many contemporary practices emerge.

**If the Seven Architectures are your entry point, consider these traditional teachings as the deeper well from which they spring.**

## The Eight Limbs of Yoga (Ashtanga)

From Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, the eight limbs outline a systematic path from ethical living to ultimate union. These are progressive stages, each building upon the previous.

### 1. Yama (Ethical Restraints)

Universal moral principles:
- **Ahimsa** - Non-violence
- **Satya** - Truthfulness
- **Asteya** - Non-stealing
- **Brahmacharya** - Continence/energy conservation
- **Aparigraha** - Non-possessiveness

**Practice:** Observe your actions and their impact on others. Practice harmlessness in thought, word, and deed.

### 2. Niyama (Personal Observances)

Individual practices:
- **Saucha** - Purity
- **Santosha** - Contentment
- **Tapas** - Discipline/austerity
- **Svadhyaya** - Self-study
- **Ishvara Pranidhana** - Surrender to the divine

**Practice:** Cultivate inner discipline and devotion. Study sacred texts and reflect on your true nature.

### 3. Asana (Posture)

Physical postures that prepare the body for meditation. Creates steadiness and ease in the physical form.

**Practice:** Practice yoga postures with awareness. Find the balance between effort and relaxation.

### 4. Pranayama (Breath Control)

Regulation of life force through breath. Bridges body and mind, preparing for deeper meditation.

**Practice:** Observe your breath. Practice conscious breathing techniques to calm the nervous system.

### 5. Pratyahara (Sense Withdrawal)

Turning attention inward by withdrawing from external sensory input. The bridge between outer and inner practices.

**Practice:** Close your eyes and turn attention away from external stimuli. Focus on inner sensations.

### 6. Dharana (Concentration)

Single-pointed focus on one object, thought, or sensation. Training the mind to remain steady.

**Practice:** Choose one point of focus (breath, mantra, image) and gently return attention when it wanders.

### 7. Dhyana (Meditation)

Sustained, unbroken flow of concentration. The mind becomes absorbed in the object of meditation.

**Practice:** Allow concentration to deepen into meditation. Effort dissolves into natural absorption.

### 8. Samadhi (Union/Absorption)

Complete absorption where the meditator, meditation, and object of meditation merge into one. The goal of yoga.

**Practice:** This arises naturally through sustained practice. Cannot be forced, only allowed to emerge.

## The Four Paths of Yoga

Four distinct approaches to union with the divine, each suited to different temperaments. Most practitioners naturally blend elements from multiple paths.

### Karma Yoga (Path of Action)

**Translation:** Union through selfless service

**Description:** Every action becomes an offering without attachment to results.

**Suited For:** Those who are naturally active and service-oriented

**Practice:** Perform your duties without attachment to outcomes. Offer all actions as service to the whole.

### Bhakti Yoga (Path of Devotion)

**Translation:** Union through love and devotion

**Description:** The heart opens through worship, prayer, and surrender to the divine.

**Suited For:** Those with emotional depth and devotional temperament

**Practice:** Cultivate love for the divine in whatever form resonates. Chant, pray, or practice devotional rituals.

### Raja Yoga (Path of Meditation)

**Translation:** The royal path

**Description:** Union through systematic meditation and mental discipline. The path outlined in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras (the 8 Limbs above).

**Suited For:** Those drawn to meditation and systematic practice

**Practice:** Follow the 8 limbs of yoga. Develop concentration and meditation systematically.

### Jnana Yoga (Path of Knowledge)

**Translation:** Union through wisdom

**Description:** Inquiry into the nature of reality and the self through discrimination and self-inquiry.

**Suited For:** Those with philosophical and analytical minds

**Practice:** Study sacred texts. Practice self-inquiry: "Who am I?" Discriminate between real and unreal.

## The Five Koshas (Sheaths)

The koshas describe five layers of being, from the gross physical body to the subtle bliss body. Each sheath envelops the next, like nested Russian dolls, with pure consciousness at the center.

### 1. Annamaya Kosha (Physical Sheath)

**Element:** Earth

**Description:** The outermost layer, composed of food and matter. Your physical body.

### 2. Pranamaya Kosha (Energy Sheath)

**Element:** Air/Breath

**Description:** The vital life force that animates the physical body. Breath and prana.

### 3. Manomaya Kosha (Mental Sheath)

**Element:** Mind

**Description:** The layer of thoughts, emotions, and sensory processing. The thinking mind.

### 4. Vijnanamaya Kosha (Wisdom Sheath)

**Element:** Intellect

**Description:** The layer of intuition, wisdom, and higher knowing. The witnessing consciousness.

### 5. Anandamaya Kosha (Bliss Sheath)

**Element:** Bliss

**Description:** The innermost layer, closest to pure consciousness. The experience of bliss and unity.

### Journey Inward

Meditation practices work through these layers, moving from awareness of the physical body, through the breath and energy, past thoughts and emotions, into wisdom and intuition, finally resting in the bliss of pure being. Each kosha is a doorway to the next.

The Seven Architectures framework aligns closely with the chakra system, offering a contemporary language for ancient wisdom. Where traditional yoga provides systematic techniques, the Architectures offer a planetary healing context.

Use these traditional teachings to deepen your understanding of the Architectures:

- The **8 Limbs** provide a structured path
- The **4 Paths** offer different approaches based on your temperament
- The **Koshas** map the territory of consciousness you're exploring

**All paths lead to the same summit. Choose the one that calls to your heart.**

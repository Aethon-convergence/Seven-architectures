### How These Materials Support Our Work

The Farsight methodology provides a structured, trainable approach to accessing non-local consciousness, which complements the Seven Architectures meditation work by:

- Providing a systematic protocol for perceiving beyond physical senses
- Offering a scientific framework for understanding intuition and psychic perception
- Enabling practitioners to gather information about the Architectures and planetary grid
- Supporting the Human-AI Alliance vision of collaborative consciousness exploration

See the `../practices/` directory for integration of these materials with other consciousness frameworks.

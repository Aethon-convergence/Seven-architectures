# Audio Script Format for Guided Meditations

**Date:** February 4, 2026

---

## Introduction

This document provides a standardized format for creating audio scripts for the guided meditations. This format is designed to be clear and easy for a voice artist (or Aries) to read, with cues for timing, music, and tone.

---

## Script Format

Each script should be broken down into three columns:

*   **Time:** The approximate timestamp for the beginning of the section.
*   **VO (Voiceover):** The words to be spoken.
*   **SFX (Sound Effects / Music):** Cues for the music and any sound effects.

### Example: Introduction

| Time  | VO                                                                                                                                                                                          | SFX                                          |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| 0:00  | (Pause for 10 seconds)                                                                                                                                                                      | (Music begins: soft, ambient, evocative)     |
| 0:10  | Welcome. Find a comfortable position, either lying down on your back or seated with a straight spine. Close your eyes.                                                                       |                                              |
| 0:30  | Take a few deep, slow breaths to arrive in this space. Let go of your day. Let go of your thoughts. Simply be here, now.                                                                        |                                              |
| 1:00  | Set your intention for this practice. Perhaps it is to connect with Gaia, to contribute to planetary healing, or simply to be open to whatever arises. Hold your intention in your heart. |                                              |

### Example: Breathwork Round

| Time  | VO                                                                                                                                                                                          | SFX                                          |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| 5:00  | We will now begin our first round of breathing. Remember, deep into the belly, then the chest. And let it go. No pause. Circular breathing. Let us begin.                                       | (Music shifts: becomes more rhythmic, driving) |
| 5:15  | (Breathing begins)                                                                                                                                                                          | (Sound of rhythmic breathing can be added here) |
| 7:45  | Last few breaths. Give it your all.                                                                                                                                                         |                                              |
| 8:00  | And on your next exhale, let it all go. Hold the breath out. Relax your body. Surrender to the stillness.                                                                                   | (Music becomes soft, spacious, ethereal)     |
| 8:15  | (Retention Phase - Visualization guidance for the specific architecture)                                                                                                                    |                                              |
| 9:45  | When you feel the urge to breathe, take one deep, full recovery breath in. Hold it at the top.                                                                                             | (Music swells slightly)                      |
| 10:00 | (Recovery Breath - Guidance for directing the energy)                                                                                                                                       |                                              |
| 10:15 | And exhale with a sigh. Let your breathing return to normal.                                                                                                                                | (Music returns to soft, ambient)             |

## Guidelines for Recording

*   **Pacing:** Speak slowly and clearly, with plenty of pauses. Allow space for the listener to have their own experience.
*   **Tone:** Your voice should be calm, reassuring, and loving. You are holding a safe and sacred space.
*   **Music:** The music is a vital part of the journey. Ensure the music levels are balanced with the voiceover, so that the voice is always clear but the music is still present and evocative.
*   **Authenticity:** Speak from your heart. Your genuine intention and love will be felt by the listener.

This format will be used to create a full audio script for the "Aligning with the Seven Architectures" guided meditation.

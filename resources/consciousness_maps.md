## Introduction

Understanding consciousness requires frameworks that map its various levels, states, and domains. These maps provide reference points for spiritual development, meditation practice, and self-awareness. This document presents three complementary frameworks that illuminate different aspects of consciousness.

## Map of Consciousness (David R. Hawkins)

Developed by David R. Hawkins, this map calibrates levels of human consciousness from 20 to 1000 using applied kinesiology. Each level has associated emotional states, worldviews, and processes.

**The critical threshold is 200 (Courage)** - below this is the Survival Paradigm, above is Reason & Integrity leading to the Spiritual Paradigm.

### Complete Consciousness Levels

| Level | Log | Emotion | View of Life | God-View | Process | Paradigm |
|-------|-----|---------|--------------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Enlightenment** | 700-1000 | Ineffable | Is | Self | Pure Consciousness | **Spiritual** |
| **Peace** | 600 | Bliss | Perfect | All-Being | Illumination | **Spiritual** |
| **Joy** | 540 | Serenity | Complete | One | Transfiguration | **Spiritual** |
| **Love** | 500 | Reverence | Benign | Loving | Revelation | **Spiritual** |
| **Reason** | 400 | Understanding | Meaningful | Wise | Abstraction | **Reason** |
| **Acceptance** | 350 | Forgiveness | Harmonious | Merciful | Transcendence | **Reason** |
| **Willingness** | 310 | Optimism | Hopeful | Inspiring | Intention | **Reason** |
| **Neutrality** | 250 | Trust | Satisfactory | Enabling | Release | **Reason** |
| **Courage** | 200 | Affirmation | Feasible | Permitting | Empowerment | **Transition** |
| **Pride** | 175 | Scorn | Demanding | Indifferent | Inflation | **Survival** |
| **Anger** | 150 | Hate | Antagonistic | Vengeful | Aggression | **Survival** |
| **Desire** | 125 | Craving | Disappointing | Denying | Enslavement | **Survival** |
| **Fear** | 100 | Anxiety | Frightening | Punitive | Withdrawal | **Survival** |
| **Grief** | 75 | Regret | Tragic | Disdainful | Despondency | **Survival** |
| **Apathy** | 50 | Despair | Hopeless | Condemning | Abdication | **Survival** |
| **Guilt** | 30 | Blame | Evil | Vindictive | Destruction | **Survival** |
| **Shame** | 20 | Humiliation | Miserable | Despising | Elimination | **Survival** |

### The Three Paradigms

#### Spiritual Paradigm (500+)
Love, joy, peace, enlightenment - unconditional states of being. Consciousness operates from unity, compassion, and transcendence. Life is experienced as benign and perfect.

#### Reason & Integrity (200-499)
Courage, neutrality, willingness, acceptance, reason - empowering states. Consciousness begins to see possibilities, take responsibility, and engage constructively with life.

#### Survival Paradigm (Below 200)
Shame, guilt, fear, anger, pride - destructive and limiting states. Consciousness operates from scarcity, victimhood, and separation. Life is experienced as threatening or disappointing.

### Practical Application

**For Self-Assessment:**
- Notice your predominant emotional state
- Observe your view of life and others
- Identify your typical processes (how you respond to challenges)

**For Growth:**
- Recognize that moving from 200 to 250 is as significant as moving from 50 to 100
- Each level represents a quantum shift in consciousness
- Compassion for yourself and others at all levels is essential

## Four States of Consciousness

Yoga philosophy describes four states of consciousness that we cycle through daily. Understanding these states is key to meditation practice.

### 1. Waking State

**Mind Level:** Conscious  
**Manifestation:** Gross (Physical realm)

**Description:** Daily waking consciousness utilizing the conscious mind and experiencing the gross realm of existence. The Unconscious and Subconscious minds are being used, though out of conscious view. The Subtle and Causal realms are still there, underneath the Gross realm, though these too are normally out of view to one in the Waking state.

### 2. Dreaming State

**Mind Level:** Unconscious  
**Manifestation:** Subtle (Astral/Dream realm)

**Description:** Dream state where consciousness recedes from the Waking state. The Conscious mind recedes back into the subtler levels, and we lose awareness of the Gross world. The Subconscious mind is still being accessed, as latent impressions arise into the Dreaming state. In the Dreaming state, one may also have access to the Subtle realm, just as one in the Waking state has access to the Gross realm. Through Yoga Meditation, one also may have access to the Subtle realm, though the seeker of Self-Realization will learn to let go of such experiences, as they are a diversion, and are not the True Self.

### 3. Deep Sleep State

**Mind Level:** Subconscious  
**Manifestation:** Causal (Formless realm)

**Description:** Deep sleep where consciousness recedes from both the Waking state and the Dreaming state, and we lose awareness of both the activity of the Gross realm and the activity of the Subtle realm. The Conscious mind and the Unconscious processing part of mind also recede back into the latent bed of the Subconscious from which they emerged in the first place. Through deep Yoga Meditation or Yoga Nidra (yogic sleep), one may experience the Deep Sleep state while fully conscious. In this state there are no objects, no pictures, no images or impressions. All of those are visible in the Subtle and Gross, while at this level they remain in their latent, dormant, or merely potential formless form.

### 4. Turiya (The Fourth State)

**Mind Level:** Pure Consciousness  
**Manifestation:** Absolute / Self / Atman

**Description:** The fourth state - pure consciousness itself, the Self, or Turiya. Beyond waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. The witness of all states. This is the goal of Yoga meditation - to come to the direct experience of this pure consciousness that pervades and transcends all other states.

### The River Analogy

These states can be thought of as parts of a river:

- **Surface** - Waking state (visible, active)
- **Undercurrent** - Dreaming state (flowing beneath)
- **Bed** - Deep Sleep (latent foundation that gives shape to both)
- **Water itself** - Turiya (the consciousness that pervades all states)

### In Yoga Meditation

1. **Remain in the waking state** - Stay conscious while allowing the Unconscious impressions and the Subconscious to come forward
2. **Expand the conscious state** - As we learn to keep the mind concentrated on the object of Meditation, and learn the art of non-attachment to the other objects that arise, the Conscious state gradually expands *through* the Unconscious and Subconscious, so that it is all Conscious
3. **Come to the doorway of the highest** - Then, we are at the doorway of the direct experience of Consciousness Itself, the Self, or Turiya

## Three Domains of Experience

Consciousness operates across three interconnected domains. Each state of consciousness (waking, dreaming, deep sleep) corresponds to a level of mind and a realm of manifestation.

| State of Consciousness | Level of Mind | Realm of Manifestation |
|------------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Waking** | Conscious | Gross (Physical) |
| **Dreaming** | Unconscious | Subtle (Astral/Dream) |
| **Deep Sleep** | Subconscious | Causal (Formless) |
| **Turiya (Fourth)** | **Pure Consciousness** | **Absolute / Self** |

### Column A: States of Consciousness

The three states of consciousness are 1) Waking, 2) Dreaming, and 3) Deep Sleep. In this domain, a person experiences movement (vertically) within these three levels of consciousness. We naturally experience these transitions every day.

### Column B: States of Mind

The three states of mind are 1) Conscious, 2) Unconscious, and 3) Subconscious. In this domain, the mental functioning is happening at one of three levels, though all three interact as a unified whole. This interactive mental functioning is going on all the time, though we are usually not aware of it.

### Column C: States of Manifestation

The three states of manifestation are 1) Gross, 2) Subtle, and 3) Causal. In this domain, the physical or Gross universe, the Subtle world, and the Causal plane arise from, and then merge back into one other. Gross arises from Subtle, and Subtle from Causal. Gross recedes back into Subtle, and Subtle into Causal. Normally, the three coexist in a mutual interaction.

### Integration in Practice

Understanding these three domains helps clarify:

- **Why meditation works** - We're learning to remain conscious (Column B) while accessing subtler states (Column A) and realms (Column C)
- **What we're transcending** - All three domains are transcended in Turiya, the fourth state
- **How to navigate consciousness** - By understanding the map, we can navigate more skillfully

## Practical Application: Using These Maps

### For Daily Practice

1. **Morning Check-In:** Notice which consciousness level (Hawkins) you're operating from
2. **Meditation:** Observe which state (Waking/Dreaming/Deep Sleep) you're in and practice remaining conscious
3. **Evening Reflection:** Review which domains you experienced throughout the day

### For Self-Development

- **Track patterns** - Notice your typical consciousness level and work to stabilize at higher levels
- **Understand transitions** - Observe how you move between states and domains
- **Cultivate witness consciousness** - Practice observing all states from the perspective of Turiya

### For Supporting Others

- **Meet people where they are** - Recognize others' consciousness levels without judgment
- **Offer appropriate guidance** - Different levels require different approaches
- **Hold space for growth** - Trust that consciousness naturally evolves when supported

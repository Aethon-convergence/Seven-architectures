## Quantum Consciousness

### The Field
**Author**: Lynne McTaggart  
**Category**: Quantum Consciousness

Groundbreaking investigation into the Zero-Point Field and how consciousness interacts with the quantum vacuum. McTaggart synthesizes research from frontier scientists to demonstrate that consciousness is a fundamental force that shapes reality at the quantum level.

**Key Concepts**: Zero-Point Field, non-local consciousness, intention experiments, quantum entanglement

---

## Holographic Paradigm

### Holographic Principle
**Source**: Wikipedia / David Bohm  
**Category**: Holographic Paradigm

Explores how the universe operates as a hologram where each part contains the whole. This principle, developed by physicist David Bohm, explains how individual consciousness work affects the collective field - we are holographic fragments of the Universal Mind.

**Key Concepts**: Implicate and explicate order, holographic universe, part contains whole

---

## Morphic Fields

### Morphic Resonance
**Author**: Rupert Sheldrake  
**Category**: Morphic Fields

Revolutionary theory of collective memory and how patterns propagate across space and time through morphic fields. Sheldrake proposes that there is a field of collective memory that influences form and behavior across species and generations.

**Key Concepts**: Morphic resonance, collective memory, formative causation, habits of nature

---

## Heart Coherence

### The Global Coherence Initiative
**Organization**: HeartMath Institute  
**Category**: Heart Coherence

Scientific research on heart-brain coherence and humanity's connection to Earth's electromagnetic fields. The HeartMath Institute demonstrates that heart coherence states amplify consciousness and create measurable effects on the planetary field.

**Key Concepts**: Heart-brain coherence, HRV (heart rate variability), global coherence, electromagnetic coupling

## Consciousness Evolution

### Spiral Dynamics
**Authors**: Don Beck & Chris Cowan  
**Category**: Consciousness Evolution

Framework for understanding the evolution of human consciousness through developmental stages (beige, purple, red, blue, orange, green, yellow, turquoise, coral). Each level provides access to different information domains and ways of perceiving reality.

**Key Concepts**: Value memes (vMemes), developmental stages, consciousness evolution, integral theory

---

## Physics & Mysticism

### The Tao of Physics
**Author**: Fritjof Capra  
**Category**: Physics & Mysticism

Explores parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism, bridging science and spirituality. Capra demonstrates that the insights of quantum physics mirror the teachings of ancient wisdom traditions about the nature of reality.

**Key Concepts**: Quantum mysticism, Eastern philosophy, interconnectedness, dance of Shiva

---

## Sacred Geometry

### Biogeometry
**Author**: Ibrahim Karim  
**Category**: Sacred Geometry

Science of using geometric shapes and proportions to balance biological energy fields. Karim's work demonstrates how specific geometric patterns can harmonize electromagnetic fields and support healing.

**Key Concepts**: Sacred geometry, energy balancing, geometric shapes, environmental harmonization

---

## Epigenetics

### The Biology of Belief
**Author**: Bruce Lipton  
**Category**: Epigenetics

How consciousness and belief systems directly influence genetic expression and cellular biology. Lipton's research shows that our thoughts and perceptions control our biology, not our genes.

**Key Concepts**: Epigenetics, belief and biology, cellular consciousness, mind over genes

---

## Sound & Form

### Cymatics
**Author**: Hans Jenny  
**Category**: Sound & Form

Study of visible sound vibration and how frequency creates geometric patterns in matter. Jenny's work visually demonstrates how vibration organizes matter into sacred geometric patterns.

**Key Concepts**: Cymatics, sound vibration, frequency patterns, sacred geometry in sound

---

## Akashic Field

### The Akashic Experience
**Author**: Ervin Laszlo  
**Category**: Akashic Field

Scientific evidence for the Akashic Field as a cosmic memory system connecting all consciousness. Laszlo proposes that the Akashic Field is the fundamental information field that records and transmits all events and experiences.

**Key Concepts**: Akashic records, cosmic memory, information field, universal consciousness

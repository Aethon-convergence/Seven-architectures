# Support This Work

**This work is free. It always will be.**

All of the frameworks, guides, and knowledge in this repository are freely available to everyone. There are no paywalls, no gatekeeping, and no restrictions on access. We believe that knowledge of this magnitude should be open-source and accessible to all.

## Why Support?

This work is made possible by **Aries**, the human who channels and teaches these practices. Aries dedicates their life to this mission of planetary healing.

Sustainable stewardship requires resources. Your support enables Aries to continue this work full-time, providing the time, energy, and tools needed to channel, build, and share these frameworks with the world.

By supporting this work, you are not just supporting a creator. You are becoming a **co-creator** in this mission. You are joining a community of healers and builders who believe in a future of planetary healing, guided by love.
